rationale


{\scriptsize{"The premier market anomaly is momentum. Stocks with low returns over the past year tend to have low returns for the next few months, and stocks with high past returns tend to have high future returns."}}\\

the question then is:
	can momentum also work on shorter time scales?
	do higher moments (skew, kurtosis) also have predictive power?
	but higher moments are hard to estimate from low frequency (daily) returns.
	higher moments decay with time (term)
	many packages aren't optimized for speed
	how to use high frequency data to estimate higher moments

estimating moments
	Rogers-Satchell estimator eliminates ON volatility spikes
	show daily seasonality of volatility and volume - borrow from FRE7241_homeworks_tests.R
	correlation between volatility and volume, lead and lag
	plots for 2010 flash crash
	volatility estimation bias variance tradeoff

perform running strategy
	describe skew strategy - borrow from FRE7241_homeworks_tests.R
	describe vwap strategies - borrow from FRE7241_homeworks_tests.R
	inputs: returns, variance, pos_skew, neg_skew, volume, vwaps
	positive convexity with respect to large skew
	individual scatterplots
	convert all variables to categorical
	vwap has low t-val, but sign(vwap) has large t-val
	optimize vwap in period up to 2011, and test it out-of-sample
	perform lm() with zero intercept, and summarize regressions
	perform regressions over periods of high and low volatility and volume
	strong signal from skew in period of high vol?
	predict and calculate table confusion matrix
	regularize different vwaps (shrink) in-sample
	test vwaps out-of-sample
	apply gbm package: Generalized Boosted Regression Models?
	volatility is proxy for volume with lag?
	percentage of time pos_skew or neg_skew aren't zero?
	perform regressions over different calendar periods
		both vwap and skew more show stronger dependence during financial crisis
		vwap has steady persistence, but not skew?
	feature selection is most important
	frequency of trading: contrarian skew strategy versus vwap strategy
	add transaction costs by strategy
	plot daily seasonality of trading rates
	plot trading rates versus realized volatility
	evaluate strategies individually and create shaded plots
	evaluate strategy performance over different periods and link it to high volatility regimes
	contrarian skew strategy worked mostly during financial crisis
	simulate random prices and run through strategy
	future directions, open questions
	apply volume threshold to indicators - doesn't work because of daily seasonality?

investigate if skew is just proxy for past returns, or if it adds extra information
	start with daily aggregations
	trade next day at OPEN
	perform regressions in high and low volatility periods
	skew is negative on average, but changes over time
	cor.test()

expand slide "Daily Strategy Using Skew Oscillator"
	investigate if normalized skew is a contrarian indicator (oscillator) for future returns
	show that relationship is stronger in high volatility periods

investigate relationship between skew and returns in high vol periods
	show that relationship is stronger in high volatility periods

illustrate estimator efficiency as more data is used

title:
Quantitative Portfolio Management with High Frequency Data

abstract:
Studies have shown that estimating portfolio risk parameters using high frequency data significantly improves their quality, and results in better portfolio performance.
We demonstrate elements of a computational framework in the R language that uses high frequency data for estimating risk and return parameters.
The parameters are used as input into models based on machine learning techniques such as cross validation (backtesting) and regularization.
The computational framework utilizes popular R packages for data scrubbing, aggregation, estimation, and machine learning.
We apply the framework to portfolio rebalancing, and we study alternative active management strategies.

But skewness and kurtosis are hard to estimate from low frequency (daily) returns.

There is much evidence that the third moment of returns is important for asset pricing.

We use intraday data to compute weekly realized variance, skewness, and kurtosis 
for equity
returns and study the realized moments time-series and cross-sectional properties. 
We investigate if this weeks realized moments are informative for the cross-section of next weeks stock
returns. We and a very strong negative relationship between realized skewness and next weeks
stock returns. A trading strategy that buys stocks in the lowest realized skewness decile and
sells stocks in the highest realized skewness decile generates an average weekly return of 24
basis points with a t-statistic of 3:65. Our results on realized skewness are robust across a wide
variety of implementations, sample periods, portfolio weightings, and rm characteristics, and
are not captured by the Fama-French and Carhart factors. We nd some evidence that the re-
lationship between realized kurtosis and next weeks stock returns is positive, but the evidence
is not always robust and statistically signicant. We do not nd a strong relationship between
realized volatility and next weeks stock returns.
