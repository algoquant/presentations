### Abstract
The large standard errors in the estimation of the mean of asset returns and their correlations produce large errors in their forecasts and in portfolio optimization.  This is exacerbated by the large skewness and fat tails (kurtosis) of asset returns, which cause the mean estimator to be less efficient than the median.  We study alternative estimators of the centrality and correlation using the median and the quantiles of asset returns, together with the Cornish-Fisher expansion.  We study the bias-variance tradeoff associated with the length of the look-back interval used for estimation, using cross-validation (backtesting).
