### *R Markdown* Documents

This is a *pdf* file knitted from an *R Markdown* document. Markdown is a simple formatting language for publishing *HTML*, *pdf*, and *MS Word* documents. For more details on using *R Markdown* see this [**RStudio website**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).  

Creating *pdf* files from *R Markdown* documents isn't difficult at all!

### Including *R* Code Chunks

*R* code chunks can be embedded in *R Markdown* documents.  They are automatically executed and their output is embedded in the output document.  
This is an *R* code chunk:

```{r mtcars, echo=TRUE}
head(mtcars)
```


### Including Math Formulas

Math formulas can be written in *LaTeX*.  For example, the Normal probability density function is given by:

$$
P(x) = \frac{e^{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2}}{\sigma\sqrt{2 \pi}}
$$

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots in *pdf* files, produced by *R* code chunks.  For example, the *R* code chunk to plot the Normal probability density function:

```{r normal, echo=TRUE}
xvar <- seq(-5, 7, length=100)
yvar <- dnorm(xvar, mean=1.0, sd=2.0)
plot(xvar, yvar, type="l", lty="solid",
     xlab="", ylab="")
title(main="Normal Density Function", line=0.5)
startd <- 3; endd <- 5  # set lower and upper bounds
# set polygon base
subv <- ((xvar >= startd) & (xvar <= endd))
polygon(c(startd, xvar[subv], endd),  # draw polygon
        c(-1, yvar[subv], -1), col="red")
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter can be added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the *R* code that generated the plot.  


Hope that you enjoy using *R Markdown*!
